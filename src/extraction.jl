    Multiple-Target State Extraction(x, threshold)

    Extracts targets whose weights (x.w) are above threshold.

    Arguments:
        x: Set of Gaussian Mixtures
        threshold: Threshold on weights. Above this threshold,
        state estimate is extracted

    Returns:
        X: Multi-Target State Estimate
